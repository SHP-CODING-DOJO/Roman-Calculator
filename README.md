### Story. As a user, when I enter two Roman numbers, I can get the sum of the two Roman numbers.

* AC1: Add two Roman numbers to get a bigger Roman number

* AC2: If a lesser numeral is put before a bigger it means subtraction of the lesser from the bigger (“IV” means four, “CM” means nine hundred)

* AC3: If the numeral is I, X or C you can’t have more than three (“II” + “II” = “IV”)

* AC4: If the numeral is V, L or D you can’t have more than one (“D” + “D” = “M”)
